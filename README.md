# Claw
Claw is an editor for the profile files used by MadCatz hardware. These files configure the effect of buttons, scroll wheels and so on.
The files are written in plain text and contain a node structure, for further details on the file format see [The pr0 file format](https://github.com/UserXXX/Claw/wiki/The-pr0-file-format).

# Planned features
- Creating/editing/deleting commands and macros
- Importing/exporting images from and to profile files
- Assigning commands and macros to keys, allowing to use different assignments for different hardware in the same profile
- Managing a "database" of commands, macros and images that can be im- and exported to profiles
